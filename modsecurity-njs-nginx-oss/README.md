# About this Project
---
This project is a POC to show how to integrate WAF capabilities (ModSecurity) with Nginx Open Source and NJS (NGINX JavaScript).

This project is inspired on https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/modsecurity-crs

Features:
- This project use OWASP CRS and enable PARANOIA level 2 only only for demo purposes

  - 200 with a payload composed by URI, HTTP Headers and parameters (not body) of the original request (using JavaScript module)
  - 400 if payload does not match with Content-Type
  - 403 is WAF detect an attack
